The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, resulting in unexpected behavior.  For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` within a flexbox context might not produce the expected result if the parent container's size is not explicitly defined.  Another issue can be incorrect unit usage within `calc()`, such as mixing percentages with pixels without considering the order of operations.
